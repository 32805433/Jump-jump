# Jump-jump
ONLY WORK ON ANDROID PHONES

This program aims to improve your score of a Wechat's small game, Jump-jump.

To let the program works properly, please follow these steps:
1. Download Vysor from http://vysor.io/ , which would help to project your phone's screen onto computer.
2. Connect your phone to the computer, enabled the USB debugging mode on your phone.
3. Open Vysor on your computer, allow it to install a program on your phone. After you see your phone screen on the computer, drag the window to the left, about 1/3 of the screen.
4. Open your Jump-jump, press Start Game.
5. Open "Jump.exe" of this repository, then click the start point and the end point on the screen every time you prepared to jump.

You can fully enjoy this program now!

If things do not work out right, you may check the following:
1. Make sure that the window of Vysor is placed in the right position (i.e. the point (400,400) is on the window).
2. If the distance you jump is not accurate, check that the window of the Vysor has a width of 418.
3. Do not change the name of "Jump.exe"
